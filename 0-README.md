# C++ Concepts and Practical Implementations

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of C++ programming exercises and object-oriented system projects. It combines fundamental concept practice with larger OOP-based simulations that model real-world systems.

The primary goal of this repository is to strengthen core C++ knowledge while developing practical software design skills through hands-on implementation.

## Focus Areas

* Core C++ language fundamentals
* Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles
* Class design and system modeling
* Modular and structured program architecture
* Real-world system simulations

## Project Structure

The repository includes both foundational programming exercises and larger object-oriented projects such as management and simulation systems. Each project is designed to reinforce problem-solving skills and improve software design practices.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a personal portfolio of my C++ development progress, demonstrating my ability to design and implement structured applications using object-oriented principles.
